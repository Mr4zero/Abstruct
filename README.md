# Abstruct
This is an unofficial repository to the mobile app called "Abstruct". That app has tons of high quality background photos for your phone, all in 4k and made by Hampus Olsson, the artist that made the OnePlus backgrounds. If you don't have a subscription to his app, you can't access all of his art, however here it's all uploaded for free. More instructions below.

# Download
It's quite easy, just press on the green "Code" button then Download ZIP and that's it, all of the images are now in an archive, which you have to unzip to use the files inside.
You can also download files by hand, but it is kind of annoying giving the fact that on Github you can't preview items before clicking on them.
